# Payload-To-Audio-Converter
In code, the payload_to_audio function takes a payload string and an output file name as input, and converts the payload data to a PCM-encoded audio file with 16-bit samples and a 44.1 kHz sample rate. You can adjust these parameters as needed for your specific application.
